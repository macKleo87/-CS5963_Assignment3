Use "q" to toggle between depth of field and bloom effect (place holder for low level ffr)

We were slightly confused by the appendix instructions but since it seemed like it was optional so long as we had 3 full pages of writing, we decided to keep the pictures interspersed in the report. We double checked and without the pictures we are still over 3 pages.

We also named our first unity project as assignment_3 like specified in the assignment, but we named the second unity project as assignment_3_part2 to help you identify which one is which. 

Thanks!
